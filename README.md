# Hi, I'm Irgendeinwer üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about NixOS and its unique approach to package management and system configuration. I love exploring the power of declarative systems and building scalable, reproducible environments.

## üöÄ Projects
- [NixOS-Dotfiles](https://github.com/Irgendeinwer/NixOS-Dotfiles): Configuration for my NixOS systems.
- [Rush](https://github.com/shub39/Rush): Android app to search, save, and share lyrics like Spotify.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- **NixOS**: My preferred operating system for declarative configurations and reproducible environments.
- **Python**: My go-to language for various scripting and automation tasks.
- **Neovim**: A text editor I use for development, still learning and exploring its full potential.
- **Git**: Version control for managing code, used for personal projects and occasional collaboration.
